                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>
                    An MSc student interested in signal processing, machine learning and programming. Recently graduated from Electronics and Electrical Engineering bachelor's studies with +1 year of experience in automated software testing. At the moment studying Signal Processing and Data Science to strengthen abilities to work with modern signal processing and machine learning technologies. Seeking for job to apply skills learned in master's studies and possibilities to do master's thesis later on the studies.

                <h2>Software testing trainee</h2>
                <p>
                    Working as a part of scrum team in embedded software testing team. Responsibilities include development and maintenance of continuous integration infra. In practice, the infra is built on Python and Groovy scripts and Jenkins jobs. The test cases were implemented using MSTest based framework and using C# programming language. Job also included test setup designing and constructing.

                <h2>Aalto-yliopisto, Electronics and Electrical Engineerig, Computer Science, Bachelor's degree</h2>
                <p>
                    Major studies introduced basic analog and digital circuit design skills to be able to analyse system stability and understand frequency and time domain behaviour. Circuit simulations are done by using LTSpice and PCB design by using KiCad. Compulsory courses included programming languages such as Python and C. Computer science minor introduced basic knowledge about software engineering, data structures, algorithms and databases. Programming is done mainly by using C++ and Python. Optional courses included digital signal processing where MATLAB and C++ is used to implement the algorithms. Bachelor's thesis about room response equalization using digital adaptive filters is to the digital signal processing area.

                <h2>Aalto-yliopisto, Signal Processing and Data Science, Master's degree</h2>
                <p>
                    The degree will merge machine learning, signal processing and statistics to be able to work with modern signal processing algorithms and large scale data. In the major studies signal processing is mainly applied for communications. However, acoustics and audio signal processing is optionally included in the study plan. In addition, embedded real-time systems are studied to understand hardware implementations and operating systems.
